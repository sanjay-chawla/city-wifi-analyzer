# City WiFi Analyzer
## Motivation:
Smart connectivity is the focus of many urban cities, growing very day by the increasing adoption of public WiFi and 5G infrastructure. This application integrates the Open Data about public WiFi locations and measures the internet speeds without impacting the user experience. This application can have a dual purpose by providing the city administration with visualisations of QoS measurements and as an application that helps citizens connect to known and secure WiFi hotspots.
## Data Visualization
[MapBox](https://www.mapbox.com) Android SDK has been used for visualisations. It is an open-source tool with extensive documentation and many out-of-the-box tools for excellent visualisations. Data for all visualisations are taken in real-time from Firestore DB.
